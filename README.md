#  News Fetching App (Python)

A simple Python-based News Application that fetches and displays the latest technology-related news articles using the **NewsAPI**. This project demonstrates how to work with REST APIs, handle JSON responses, and make HTTP requests in Python.



##  Features

* Fetches real-time news articles
* Filters news based on a keyword (currently **technology**)
* Displays article titles along with their URLs
* Shows the total number of articles fetched
* Clean and beginner-friendly Python code



##  Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Requests Library**
* **NewsAPI**



##  Project Structure

```
news-app/
│
├── main.py        # Main application file
├── config.py      # Stores API key (not pushed to GitHub)
├── README.md      # Project documentation
```



##  Customization

You can easily modify the search keyword by changing this line in `main.py`:

```python
query = "technology"
```

Example:

```python
query = "sports"
```



##  What I Learned

* Making API calls using Python
* Parsing JSON responses
* Working with third-party APIs
* Writing clean and modular code
